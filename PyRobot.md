PyRobot was originally created for this [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/ENNF6R6F6B7STLM/) for using the Create and an OLPC for telepresence. Since then, the telepresence project has become project Fido. Fido uses a [GSD](http://code.google.com/p/getshitdone) web interface for controlling the Create/Roomba over the internet.

Fido Features
  * Automated docking and charging of both the OLPC and the Create.
  * Arduino control of the Create's power and a high-intensity LED flashlight for night driving.
  * Control of a QuickCam Orbit in addition to the OLPC's built in camera.
  * Automatic diagnostics to keep the robot running.
  * Text-to-speech synthesis using Flite.

Fido Web Interface Features
  * Remote control of movement, lighting, and Flite.
  * Streaming sensor data with sparklines.
  * Streaming logging from the Fido server.
  * Click-to-pan control of the Orbit (clicking on the webcam image pans/tilts to center on that position).
